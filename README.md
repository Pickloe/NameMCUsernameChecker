# NameMC Username Checker
This checker will check through a list of usernames from the file "users.txt" through NameMC. It will then come up with 4 different possiblities which are "unavailable", "Exceeded Maximum Characters", "available", and "available later" which includes the date of when it will be able in UTC timzone. This was created for ***educational purposes only*** and I have added comments to what all the lines do for those who are curious how it works. ***I am not responsible for anything that you do.***

# Installation
First step make sure that you have python 3 installed, if you don"t know how to install python you can visit this link and it"ll show you how to install python 3. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvcQlPZ8ecA

Once you"ve made sure you have Python 3 installed, you can go ahead and download the files. Once you have extracted the files to your desktop, you will want to open command prompt and "cd" into it for example "cd C:\Users\USERNAME\Desktop\NameMCUsernameChecker" (Make sure to replace USERNAME with your username to your computer) Then you will want to type in "pip install -r requirements.txt" which will install the dependencies required to run this.

Once you have done all that, you will need to add the list of usernames you want to check to the file called "users.txt". Now, you can type in "python NameMCChecker.py" and it will start running the program. It should look something like this if you did everything correctly.

# To-do List

 - Add multi-threading (too make the program faster)
 - Remove false Availables (A lot of the times there might be false available simply because mojang blocked the name)
